# You Too Can Build a Bot - Connect.TECH Demo Conference Bot

This is a sample Microsoft Bot Framework bot written in Node.JS for demonstration at my "You Too Can Build a Bot" speaking series, which has been presented at these conferences:

* [Desert Code Camp 2016](http://oct2016.desertcodecamp.com/session/1300 "Conference Site")
* [Milwaukee Code Camp 2016](http://milwaukeecodecamp.com/ "Conference Site")
* [Connect.TECH / ConnectJS 2016](http://connect.tech/ "Conference Site")

This bot is meant to be a basic example of the Microsoft Bot Framework for beginners to fork and extend. It is not a complete production bot. Pull requests are welcome for those who would like to contribute.

An `npm install` is all that is needed to retrieve the necessary dependencies.
