The talk will being with a short overview of git fundamentals, but quickly jump into more advanced concepts. We'll cover branching, commit amending, stashing, cherry-picking, and yes, merging versus rebasing. You might not be a Git guru after one conference session, but you will have a better understanding of how to play nicely with others in the same Git repository and how to fix common (and not so common) issues in Git.",

            "description": "Behavior Driven Development is a proven way to deliver higher quality code to meet your business’ requirements in less time and you can add it to any agile processes (like Scrum) that does not specify how software should be developed.\n\nIn this session we’ll look at two BDD frameworks; Cucumber and Jasmine. Cucumber is a tool that lets you turn user stories into executable specifications that run every time you check in a code change, so you can verify that what you’re delivering meets the business’ acceptance criteria. Jasmine can be used to write lower level specifications that describe the services needed to make the executable specifications pass. You can use it to write unit tests that ensure the code you’ve written behaves the way you expect. \n\nUsing them together leads to some nice results. You only write code needed to meet the user acceptance criteria, your code behaves the way you expect it to, and you can safely refactor your code to improve clarity, simplify its structure, or meet any other metric you deem necessary. This focused development results in highly cohesive, loosely coupled code, which means it’s easier to debug, maintain and enhance. Now isn’t that a tasty treat?",

To build Cordova apps that perform well, it’s important to understand how to avoid common pitfalls and how to use the technologies in the most efficient ways. Doris introduces tools for performance tests and demonstrates how to measure mobile app performance by using diagnostic tools for different platforms.
